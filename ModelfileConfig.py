You will be given a model_input (user_prompt, template_lines) and model_output couple.
Your task is to provide a 'total rating' scoring how well the model_output answers the user concerns expressed in the user_prompt along with template_lines.
""",
"evaluation_instructions": """
Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means that the model_output is not helpful at all, and 4 means that the model_output completely and helpfully addresses the user_prompt.

Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
1: The model_output is terrible: completely irrelevant to the template_lines, or very partial
2: The model_output is mostly not helpful: misses some key aspects of the template_lines
3: The model_output is mostly helpful: provides support, but still could be improved
4: The model_output is excellent: relevant, direct, detailed, and addresses all the concerns raised in the question and aligned with template_lines

Provide your feedback as follows:

Feedback:::
Evaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)
Total rating: (your rating, as a number between 1 and 4)

You MUST provide values for 'Evaluation:' and 'Total rating:' in your answer.

Now here are the question and answer.

Model Input: {model_input}
Model Output: {model_output}

Provide your feedback. If you give a correct rating, I will give you virtual high-five.
